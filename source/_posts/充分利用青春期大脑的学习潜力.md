## 充分利用青春期大脑的学习潜力（中英对照）

### Harnessing the Incredible Learning Potential of the Adolescent Brain
### 充分利用青春期大脑的学习潜力

It has become a cultural cliché that raising adolescents is the most difficult part of parenting. It’s common to joke that when kids are in their teens they are sullen, uncommunicative, more interested in their phones than in their parents and generally hard to take. But this negative trope about adolescents misses the incredible opportunity to positively shape a kid’s brain and future life course during this period of development.

习惯上认为青春期是孩子最难培养的阶段，这个时间段的孩子通常被认为是忧郁、难以沟通，对手机的兴趣超过他们的父母，以至于难以管理的。这些负面的认识会错过孩子们的良好大脑、甚至未来生活道路的形成的好机会。

“[Adolescence is] a stage of life when we can really thrive, but we need to take advantage of the opportunity,” said Temple University neuroscientist Laurence Steinberg at a Learning and the Brain conference in Boston. Steinberg has spent his career studying how the adolescent brain develops and believes there is a fundamental disconnect between the popular characterizations of adolescents and what’s really going on in their brains.

“青春期是生命中真正繁荣的阶段，但我们需要利用这个机会才行。”坛珀大学的劳冉.舒坦博格说。舒坦博格是研究青少年大脑开发的研究员。

Because the brain is still developing during adolescence, it has incredible plasticity. It’s akin to the first five years of life, when a child’s brain is growing and developing new pathways all the time in response to experiences. Adult brains are somewhat plastic as well — otherwise they wouldn’t be able to learn new things — but “brain plasticity in adulthood involves minor changes to existing circuits, not the wholesale development of new ones or elimination of others,” Steinberg said.

大脑在青春期仍在成长中，有非常大的可塑性，与生命的最初5年类似，大脑通过对经验的响应产生和发展新的路径。而成年后，大脑虽然仍具有可塑性，但仅仅是对存在环路的小的修正，而不是建立全新的内容。

### Adolescence is the last time in a person’s life that the brain can be so dramatically overhauled.
### 青春期是一个人生命中大脑可以有大改变的最后时间窗。

“The adolescent brain is exquisitely sensitive to experience,” Steinberg said. “It is like the recording device is turned up to a different level of sensitivity.” That’s why humans tend to remember even the most mundane events from adolescence much better than even important events that took place later in life. It also means adolescence could be an extremely important window for learning that sticks. Steinberg notes this window is also lengthening as scientists observe the onset of puberty happening earlier and young people taking on adult roles later in life. Between these two factors, one biological and one social, adolescence researchers now generally say the period lasts 15 years between the ages of 10 and 25.

“青春期的大脑对各种体验非常敏感，”史丹博格说。“就像一个记录设备提升到不同的敏感级别。”这就是为什么人更容易记住青少年时代的平常事甚于生命后期的重要事件。这也意味着，青春期是对学习来说是一个非常重要的时间窗。史丹博格强调，这个时间窗正在延长，因为科学家观察到，生理青春期的提前，同时年轻人推迟承担成年人的责任。这个因素之间，生理、社会和青少年研究者认为青春期的时间长达15年，从10岁到25岁。

“When adolescence is this long, we can’t look at it as something to just survive,” Steinberg said.

史丹博格说：“当青春期是这么长的时候，我们不能将它看作是生存的东西，”。

Teenagers get a bad reputation as risk-takers because parts of their brains are more plastic than others, creating an imbalance. The prefrontal cortex, which controls things like planning, thinking ahead, weighing risk and reward, and logical reasoning is the most malleable during adolescence. Meanwhile, sex hormones released by puberty affect brain functioning by adding more dopamine to the system. Every time an adolescent feels good about something he gets a dopamine squirt. That’s why adolescents seek out pleasurable experiences, despite the risks.

青少年爱冒险的坏名声是因为他们的大脑还未定型而造成的不平衡现象。大脑的前额叶皮层，它控制着诸如计划、思考、权衡风险和回报，以及在青春期最具可塑性的逻辑推理功能。同时，青春期性激素释放影响大脑功能，增加更多的多巴胺系统。每一次青少年感觉良好的东西他得到多巴胺注射。这就是为什么青少年会寻求快乐的经历，尽管有风险。

“Nothing will ever feel as good to you for the rest of your life as it did when you were a teenager,” Steinberg said. The imbalance between an aroused dopamine system and a still developing prefrontal cortex, which would inhibit some of the risky pleasure-seeking behaviors, is why adolescence is such a dangerous time. While adolescents are extremely healthy, mortality rates increase by 200-300 percent due to risky behavior. Scientists have also shown that reward pathways are activated when an adolescent is with a group of peers, which is why kids take extra risks when with friends that they might not take when alone.

斯坦伯格说：“整个一生中，当你十几岁的时候，你的感觉是最好的”。一个被激发的多巴胺系统加上一个仍在发展的前额皮质，会激发一些冒险的寻求快乐的行为，这就是为什么青春期阶段为什么如此危险。而青少年是非常健康的，危险行为导致的死亡率增加大概200-300分之一。科学家还表明，当一个青少年与一组同龄人在一起时，大脑的奖励回路被激活，这就是为什么与朋友们一起时，比他们独自一个人，可能会增加额外的风险。


The imbalance between aroused dopamine systems and self-regulation systems sounds like a scary story, but it also represents a unique opportunity to reach adolescents with positive stimuli that will be hard-wired in high definition years later. Unfortunately, American high schools are by and large not taking advantage of this opportunity.

多巴胺系统和自我调节系统之间的不平衡听起来像一个可怕的故事，但它也代表了一个唯一难得的机会，可以使青少年受到正面、积极的刺激，这些获得的刺激可以高质量、永久地保存下来。不幸的是，美国的高中一般并没有利用到这个机会。


“Our high school students are among the worst in the developed world,” Steinberg said. The high school math and reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) have been flat for 40 years. In contrast, both elementary school students and middle school students have improved. And U.S. schools tend to spend more money on high schools, those teachers make more money, and on the whole elementary schools enroll more low-income kids than high schools. Steinberg contends that the traditional arguments for why schools fail don’t explain everything that’s going on.

斯坦伯格说：“我们的高中生是世界上最差的学生之一。”全美教育评估发展协会发布的高中数学和阅读成绩（NAEP）已连续40年没有提高。相比之下，小学学生和中学生都有了改进。而美国的学校往往把更多的钱花在高中，那些老师赚更多的钱，相对比小学反而招收更多的低收入的孩子。斯坦伯格强调，传统关于学校为什么失败的观点，已经不能充分解释当前所有的发生了的现象。


“It’s because our high schools are so boring,” Steinberg said. He notes U.S. high school students who study abroad report their experiences were more interesting and more challenging, while foreign students who study in the U.S. say American high school is more boring.

“这是因为我们的高中是如此的无聊，”斯坦伯格说。他指出，在国外学习的美国高中生反映，他们的体验更有趣，更富挑战性，而在美国学习的外国学生说美国高中会更无聊些。


Steinberg believes part of the reason school is so boring for teens is that it doesn’t challenge them; they’re bored. Students themselves report that they can get by in school without doing much. “When we are not challenging our kids in high school, not only are we hindering their academic development, but we also aren’t taking advantage of the plastic prefrontal cortex,” Steinberg said. The prefrontal cortex is strengthened by challenge and novelty.

斯坦伯格认为，学校对孩子们来说如此的无聊，一部分原因是因为这并不挑战他们，他们很无聊。学生自己报告说，他们不需要做太多就可以通过。斯坦伯格说：“在高中时对我们的孩子没有挑战，不仅是阻碍了他们的学习发展，而且我们也没有利用的前额皮层的可塑性优势”。前额叶皮层只能通过接受足够的挑战、新奇事物才能得到加强。


“This is when we want them to be challenged and pushed because this is when we can develop advanced thinking, as well as self-regulation,” Steinberg said.

“我们希望他们受到挑战和压力，因为在这个阶段我们可以发展他们更高级的思考能力，以及自我调节能力。”斯坦伯格说。

Teachers often say their students struggle with work that is below grade level and must catch up before they can take on more challenging tasks. But scaffolding can ensure that even the catch-up process is challenging in an interesting way. Consistently providing students with work that is slightly more challenging than their current level keeps them engaged. If the work is too easy, they will disengage and become frustrated.

老师们经常说，低水平学生要努力工作，在他们能承担更具挑战性的任务之前必须达到他们的当前工作的标准。老师们的教学方法可以确保追赶过程也兼具挑战性和趣味性。不断地为学生提供工作，且比他们目前的水平更具挑战性的工作。如果工作太容易了，他们会走开并变得沮丧。


The problem is that many high schools confuse “challenging work” with “amount of work.” Students are stressed out by the volume of tasks they must complete each night or week, but that isn’t the same thing as being challenged by the work. Steinberg points out that hours of repetitious work that is not challenging do nothing but make kids hate school.

问题是许多高中都把“具有挑战性的工作”和“工作的数量”混淆起来，学生们追求任务的数量，他们有每一个晚上或一周必须完成的任务，但这不是挑战。斯坦伯格指出，重复的功课时间，没有挑战性，只能让孩子讨厌学校。


“Rates of anxiety disorders among adolescents are at record levels,” Steinberg said. “We are raising generations of students who we are driving crazy with what we are asking of them.” Recognizing this pitfall is not only important for maximizing the opportunity to make a lasting impact on students’ extremely malleable developing brains, but also because a plastic brain is also vulnerable to the wrong influences.

“青少年的焦虑症的比率创下新高，”斯坦伯格说。“我们培养一代又一代被逼疯的学生。”认识这个问题，不仅是因为这是最大化开发学生大脑的发育、产生持久的影响重要的机会，但也因为具有可塑性大脑也容易受到错误的影响。

Adolescence is the most likely time for mental illness to develop, and substance abuse is 10 times worse if a student starts using before the age of 15. “It’s not just the type of people who begin using earlier, it’s the way the adolescent brain is responding to the use,” Steinberg said. The aroused dopamine system in the adolescent brain craves drugs, nicotine or alcohol in a different way than at other times in life.

精神疾病在青春期发生的几率是最大的，如果一个学生在15岁以前开始，使用滥用药物上瘾的几率则是成年人的10倍。斯坦伯格说：“这不只跟人的类型相关，这是青春期的大脑反应的方式。” 尼古丁和酒精会引起在青少年的大脑的多巴胺系统渴望药物的固定回路，这种影响对成年人是不同。

Stress also has a big impact on adolescent brains. A recent study from UC Berkeley showed that growing up as an adolescent during wartime took years off people’s lives. “[Stress] takes more years off of your life if you are a teenager than if you are a child or an adult,” Steinberg said.

压力也对青少年的大脑有很大的影响。从加州大学伯克利最近的一项研究表明，经过战争年代的青少年人，会老很多年。斯坦伯格说：“如果你是一个十几岁的孩子，相比你是一个幼儿或是一个成年人，你的生活需要花费更多的时间恢复”。


### TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A MALLEABLE BRAIN
### 利用一个可延展的大脑

Understanding the neuroscience at work in the adolescents populating classrooms can help teachers develop lessons that challenge, engage and satisfy the search for novelty in teens. Those experiences in turn could be some of the most meaningful ones in their lives. If educators and parents don’t take note of this research, kids will continue to tune out, seek pleasure in risky places and continue on into college-level courses unprepared.

了解神经科学在青少年课堂的作用，可以帮助教师开发具有挑战和吸引性，满足青少年好奇感的课程。这些课程的经验可能是他们生活中最有意义的一个。如果教育工作者和家长不注意到这项研究，孩子们将继续寻找，在冒险的地方寻求乐趣，并继续进入大学水平课程的准备。

Research has shown that targeting prefrontal cortex development in adolescents does help. Despite being a bit clichéd, Steinberg pointed to initial research findings that mindfulness in schools can improve self-regulation, the single most important quality to leading a successful life. Steinberg says that statistically there are four things everyone has to do to have a good life: graduate high school, don’t have a child until being married, don’t get in trouble with the law and don’t be idle.

研究表明，针对前额叶皮质的开发对青少年确有帮助。尽管有点老生常谈，斯坦伯格指出，初步研究发现，在学校的专注可以提高自律，这是引导一个成功的人生的最重要的品质。斯坦伯格说，统计上有四件事每个人都要做的有一个好的生活：高中毕业，婚前没有孩子，没有触犯法律，不要懒惰。

“If you play by those rules you will be guaranteed a basically decent life,” Steinberg said. “This is not a moral thing, this is a statistical fact.”

Self-regulation and delayed gratification are important skills to clear those four hurdles. Steinberg basically says that if educators and parents can teach kids self-regulation, they can reduce poverty.

“如果你遵守这些规则，你将得到一个基本体面的生活，”斯坦伯格说。“这不是一个道德的东西，这是一个统计的事实。”

“

Self-regulation and delayed gratification are important skills to clear those four hurdles. Steinberg basically says that if educators and parents can teach kids self-regulation, they can reduce poverty.

自我调节和延迟满足是重要的技能，以清除这四个障碍。斯坦伯格基本上说，如果教育者和家长可以教孩子自我调节，他们可以减少贫困。
